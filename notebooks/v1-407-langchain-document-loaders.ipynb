       "[Document(page_content='Posted on October 5, 2023\\n\\nAI Accelera\\n\\nNo Comments\\n\\nThe new book “100 AI Startups” by Julio Colomer presents 100 new Artificial Intelligence companies that have earned at least $500,000 in their first year of existence and are radically changing how things are done in over 30 sectors, including banking, insurance, health, education, legal, logistics, marketing, sales, customer service, and even in public administration.\\n\\nThese 100 startups from Silicon Valley show how the fastest-growing area among the new Artificial Intelligence companies are the new LLM Apps (LLM Apps), which are changing every sector and areas of the company.\\n\\nIt’s not science fiction. There are already startups with LLM Applications that have earned more than $500,000 before their first year of existence by doing this:\\n\\nImproving the effectiveness of surgeons.\\n\\nCustomer service in banks.\\n\\nTutoring for students.\\n\\nLegal recommendations.\\n\\nStock analysis.\\n\\nDelivering physiotherapy sessions.\\n\\nFinding new clients.\\n\\nImmigration management.\\n\\nAudits.\\n\\nManaging contracts with Public Administration.\\n\\nManaging construction projects.\\n\\nEvent organization.\\n\\nManaging defaults.\\n\\nAnswering (yes, answering) surveys.\\n\\nGenerating news.\\n\\nNegotiating a sales contract.\\n\\nValuing a company.\\n\\nTaking notes in meetings.\\n\\n“Once again the future is being invented in Silicon Valley. And this time with an intensity not seen since the first wave of the Internet,” comments Julio Colomer.\\n\\n“In this wave, it’s not just venture capitalists, accelerators, and startups that are involved. All the major tech companies, from Microsoft to Google, including Apple, Facebook, Tesla, and Salesforce, have jumped in with multimillion-dollar investments in Generative Artificial Intelligence. We haven’t seen such unanimous interest in the last twenty years.”\\n\\nBeyond the initial interest generated by the launch of ChatGPT, little is known by the general public about how AI can be used to make money, be more productive, or live better.\\n\\n“The importance of this book is that it helps visualize what can already be done with the new Generative Artificial Intelligence. This is valuable not only for entrepreneurs looking for ideas but for executives and professionals from all sectors who want to advance in their professional careers.”\\n\\n“This book confirms the changes we announced in the previous book, Keys to Artificial Intelligence:\\n\\nFirst, that the new Artificial Intelligence inherits from Machine Learning and Data Science but is not the same. One is mistaken to think that the professional skills needed to build the new LLM Applications are the same as those needed for data analysis or a prediction model.\\n\\nSecond, that today the key is the LLM Applications, which ride on the backs of the Foundation LLMs (ChatGPT, Llama2, etc.) combining them with external data sources and APIs.\\n\\nThird, that the development of LLM Applications is experiencing exponential growth in the United States and will soon reach other countries: every company wants to have LLM Applications. This opens an excellent employment opportunity for those who enter this new field.”\\n\\nYou can see the table of contents of the book “100 AI Startups” here.\\n\\nThe books “100 AI Startups” and “Keys to Artificial Intelligence” can be found on Amazon.\\n\\n“We are in a new world. LLM Applications use methods and tools that were practically unknown three years ago: embeddings, vector databases, orchestration frameworks, LLM cache, prompt engineering, etc.”\\n\\nThe AI Accelerator (aceleradoraAI.com), with a presence in Spain, Latin America, and the United States, offers courses to learn how to create LLM Applications and other related services such as:\\n\\nDevelopment of LLM Applications for companies.\\n\\nDevelopment of LLM Applications for startups.\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence consulting services for companies.\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence training services for companies.\\n\\nStaff selection to form AI Teams in the company.\\n\\nTechnical support for entrepreneurs wanting to create an AI startup.\\n\\nAI Test Field: connecting entrepreneurs and junior developers.\\n\\nFor more information, visit the AI Accelera website.\\n\\nFor each of the 100 startups analyzed in the book “100 IA Startups“, it details:\\n\\nProblem solved.\\n\\nProposed solution.\\n\\nTechnical analysis.\\n\\nIdentifying data of the company, its website, and its founders.\\n\\nThe startup presented in the book use LLM Applications to solve the described problems.
